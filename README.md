# XRUIOS Default App Suite

The default app suite for the XRUIOS!

Much more information coming with the completion of the library! This will include the maximized/minimized versions of all apps alongside a Stride3D (VR) version of the UI and a possible CMD variant!

You can view the designs being used at

This is for the base theme of the XRUIOS; some themes will be inherently more 3Desque compared to this!
